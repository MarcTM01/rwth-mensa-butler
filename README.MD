## :gear: Architecture
The entire skill is hosted on AWS. All parts of the skill are serverless and their source code is contained in this repository. This way I do not need to pay anything to maintain this skill.
The following diagram shows the architecture of the skill:

*FYI: I injected some fancy CSS into the SVG generated by draw.io to ensure that it looks good in dark mode and light mode. What a time to be alive!*

### Design decisions
**Q:** Why does the skill lambda directly access the database instead of using an API Gateway?

**A:** Amazon does not charge for invocations of the skill lambda. 
However, they do charge for invocations of any other lambda or usage of an API Gateway (beyond the 12-month free tier).
I want to avoid any case where a user-made request would result in a charge for me as this could easily be abused by a malicious user.
Accessing the database directly does not incur any cost as the always-free tier of AWS includes sufficient reserved capacity units for this skill.


**Q:** Why are the different components of the skill written in different languages?

**A:** The scrapper is written in go primarily because I wanted to learn go.
At the time of creation, amazon does not support the creation of alexa-hosted skills in go. Therefore, I went with python for the skill lambda.
